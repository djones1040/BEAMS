These codes perform a Bayesian Estimation of Multiple Species (BEAMS) procedure
(Kunz, Bassett & Hlozek 2007).  It is meant to be generalized to several applications.

It requires the usual python libraries (numpy, scipy, etc), along with emcee, available at 
http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/user/install/

There's no real install file yet, just put the BEAMS directory in your PATH.

doBEAMS.py -h

will provide the rest of the documentation.
